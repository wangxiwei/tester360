Javascript\nThis book will teach you the basics of programming and Javascript. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the JavaScript programming language.\n\nJavaScript (JS for short) is the programming language that enables web pages to respond to user interaction beyond the basic level. It was created in 1995, and is today one of the most famous and used programming languages.\n"},"basics/":{"url":"basics/","title":"Basics","body":"Basics about Programming\nIn this first chapter, we&#39;ll learn the basics of programming and the Javascript language.\nProgramming means writing code. A book is made up of chapters, paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words and finally punctuation and letters, likewise a program can be broken down into smaller and smaller components. For now, the most important is a statement. A statement is analogous to a sentence in a book. On its own, it has structure and purpose, but without the context of the other statements around it, it isn&#39;t that meaningful.\nA statement is more casually (and commonly) known as a line of code. That&#39;s because statements tend to be written on individual lines. As such, programs are read from top to bottom, left to right. You might be wondering what code (also called source code) is. That happens to be a broad term which can refer to the whole of the program or the smallest part. Therefore, a line of code is simply a line of your program.\nHere is a simple example:\nvar hello = &quot;Hello&quot;;\nvar world = &quot;World&quot;;\n\n// Message equals &quot;Hello World&quot;\nvar message = hello + &quot; &quot; + world;\n\nThis code can be executed by another program called an interpreter that will read the code, and execute all the statements in the right order.\n"},"basics/comments.html":{"url":"basics/comments.html","title":"Comments","body":"Comments\nComments are statements that will not be executed by the interpreter, comments are used to mark annotations for other programmers or small descriptions of what your code does, thus making it easier for others to understand what your code does.\nIn Javascript, comments can be written in 2 different ways:\n\nLine starting with //:\n\n// This is a comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter\nvar a = &quot;this is a variable defined in a statement&quot;;\n\n\nSection of code starting with /*and ending with */, this method is used for multi-line comments:\n\n/*\nThis is a multi-line comment,\nit will be ignored by the interpreter\n*/\nvar a = &quot;this is a variable defined in a statement&quot;;\n\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\nMark the editor&#39;s contents as a comment\n\n\n\t\n\tMark me as a comment\nor I&#39;ll throw an error\n\n\t/*\nMark me as a comment\nor I&#39;ll throw an error\n*/\n\tassert(true);\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\n"},"basics/variables.html":{"url":"basics/variables.html","title":"Variables","body":"Variables\nThe first step towards really understanding programming is looking back at algebra. If you remember it from school, algebra starts with writing terms such as the following.\n3 + 5 = 8\n\nYou start performing calculations when you introduce an unknown, for example x below:\n3 + x = 8\n\nShifting those around you can determine x:\nx = 8 - 3\n-&gt; x = 5\n\nWhen you introduce more than one you make your terms more flexible - you are using variables:\nx + y = 8\n\nYou can change the values of x and y and the formula can still be true:\nx = 4\ny = 4\n\nor\nx = 3\ny = 5\n\nThe same is true for programming languages. In programming, variables are containers for values that change. Variables can hold all kind of values and also the results of computations. Variables have a name and a value separated by an equals sign (=). Variable names can be any letter or word, but bear in mind that there are restrictions from language to language of what you can use, as some words are reserved for other functionality.\nLet&#39;s check out how it works in Javascript, The following code defines two variables, computes the result of adding the two and defines this result as a value of a third variable.\nvar x = 5;\nvar y = 6;\nvar result = x + y;\n\n"},"basics/types.html":{"url":"basics/types.html","title":"Types","body":"Variable types\nComputers are sophisticated and can make use of more complex variables than just numbers. This is where variable types come in. Variables come in several types and different languages support different types.\nThe most common types are:\n\nNumbers\nFloat: a number, like 1.21323, 4, -33.5, 100004 or 0.123\nInteger: a number like 1, 12, -33, 140 but not 1.233\n\n\nString: a line of text like &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot; or &quot;damn, you are tall!&quot;\nBoolean: either true or false, but nothing else\nArrays: a collection of values like: 1,2,3,4,&#39;I am bored now&#39;\nObjects: a representation of a more complex object\nnull: a variable that contains null contains no valid Number, String, Boolean, Array, or Object\nundefined: the undefined value is obtained when you use an object property that does not exist, or a variable that has been declared, but has no value assigned to it.\n\nJavaScript is a “loosely typed” language, which means that you don&#39;t have to explicitly declare what type of data the variables are. You just need to use the var keyword to indicate that you are declaring a variable, and the interpreter will work out what data type you are using from the context, and use of quotes.\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nCreate a variable named `a` using the keyword `var`.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tvar a;\n\ta;\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\n"},"basics/equality.html":{"url":"basics/equality.html","title":"Equality","body":"Equality\nProgrammers frequently need to determine the equality of variables in relation to other variables. This is done using an equality operator.\nThe most basic equality operator is the == operator. This operator does everything it can to determine if two variables are equal, even if they are not of the same type.\nFor example, assume:\nvar foo = 42;\nvar bar = 42;\nvar baz = &quot;42&quot;;\nvar qux = &quot;life&quot;;\n\nfoo == bar will evaluate to true and baz == qux will evaluate to false, as one would expect. However, foo == baz will also evaluate to true despite foo and baz being different types. Behind the scenes the == equality operator attempts to force its operands to the same type before determining their equality. This is in contrast to the === equality operator.\nThe === equality operator determines that two variables are equal if they are of the same type and have the same value.

If you test that the thing you want to do is possible and has all the required information in the right format, that won’t happen, and your program will be a lot more stable. Taking such precautions is also known as programming defensively.\nThe other thing conditions can do for you is allow for branching.

Using function composition, we could do this as follows:\nprocess_add_2 = function(list) {\n    return map(add_2, list);\n}\nprocess_double = function(list) {\n    return map(double, list);\n}\nprocess_add_2([5,6,7]) // =&gt; [7, 8, 9]\nprocess_double([5,6,7]) // =&gt; [10, 12, 14]\n\nNow let&#39;s create a function called buildProcessor that takes a function func as input\nand returns a func-processor, that is, a function that applies func to each input in list.\n// a function that generates a list processor that performs\nvar buildProcessor = function(func) {\n    var process_func = function(list) {\n        return map(func, list);\n    }\n    return process_func;\n}\n// calling buildProcessor returns a function which is called with a list input\n\n\n// using buildProcessor we could generate the add_2 and double list processors as follows:\nprocess_add_2 = buildProcessor(add_2);\nprocess_double = buildProcessor(double);\n\nprocess_add_2([5,6,7]) // =&gt; [7, 8, 9]\nprocess_double([5,6,7]) // =&gt; [10, 12, 14]\n\nLet&#39;s look at another example.\nWe&#39;ll create a function called buildMultiplier that takes a number x as input and returns a function that multiplies its argument by x :\nvar buildMultiplier = function(x) {\n    return function(y) {\n        return x * y;\n    }\n}\n\nvar double = buildMultiplier(2);\nvar triple = buildMultiplier(3);\n\ndouble(3); // =&gt; 6\ntriple(3); // =&gt; 9\n\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nDefine a function named `negate` that takes `add1` as argument and returns a function, that returns the negation of the value returned by `add1`.
